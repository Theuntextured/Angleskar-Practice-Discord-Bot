# Angleskar Practice Discord Bot
 A Discord bot which handles practice sessions, members, teams, and attendence for esports team practice.

NOTE: To use the bot, you will need to host your own bot. I'm too lazy to make it work everywhere. All you ned to do is clone the repository and add a file named "token.txt" which ONLY contains the Discord bot token.
